# SMS-Classifier
As an intern at Bharat Intern, I developed an SMS Classifier to detect spam messages. This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify SMS messages, ensuring efficient and accurate spam detection. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to achieve high accuracy and reliability.
